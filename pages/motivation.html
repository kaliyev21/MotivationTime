		<h1>2. The Power of Positive Thinking</h1>

	<div class="books_cards">
		<img src="../images/book2.jpg">
		<br>
		<p>When it was first published, both psychologists and theologians attacked this book as heretical, and accused author Norman
			Vincent Peale of being a crank. Today, science has verified the book's basic concept--that being optimistic makes you
			healthier and happier and thus more likely to succeed.
			<br> Best quote: "Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of
			fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But
			any action is better than no action at all."

			No longer is someone coming to hire you, to invest in your company, to sign you, to pick you. It’s on you to make the
			most important decision in your life: Choose Yourself.</p>
