			<h1>Steve Jobs – If Today Was The Last Day Of My Life</h1>
			<hr style="margin-left: 70px; margin-top: 20px; width: 770px;">
			<p>No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to Heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It’s life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now, the new is you, but someday not to long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it’s quite true.</p><br>

				<h2>The Motivational Video That Broke The Internet</h2>
				<p>This video took so many hours to produce, but the reaction has been amazing and more than 15 000 people have shared in Facebook already! So please if you like it, don’t forget to share the inspiration with others!</p>

				<h2>This Video Will Make You Want To Get Up And Go To The Gym</h2>
				<P>This sounds obvious, but it’s probably the number one reason guys don’t stick with their gym routine — they pick something they hate doing. Maybe you read about how great Crossfit is for getting into shape. Or perhaps you were impressed with the idea of putting on 30 pounds of muscle by lifting heavy this year. Still, the best exercise routine isn’t going to do any good if it doesn’t inspire you to stick with it.</P>

			<h1>A Message to People Who Want to Succeed – Keep Going After Your Dreams</h1>
			<hr style="margin-left: 70px; margin-top: 20px; width: 770px;">
			<p>I hope that I can change your mindset and if I can do that – I promise you, you will be able to change your life. This is why I think you should watch those videos for a few minutes after you wake up and before you go to bed. Go to bed with a head full of dreams and then wake up listen to one of these motivational videos again, then make a plan and seize your day.</p>

				<h2>Are You Feeling Down? Watch This Video Now!</h2>
				<p>People are always blaming circumstances for what they are. I don’t believe in circumstances. The people who get ahead in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can’t find them, make them. So if you are #AboutToGiveUp – don’t do it because later on in life you will regret it. So go out there and do what you have to do and make your dreams come true, but don’t make excuses as to why you can’t achieve something.</p>

				<h2>The Secret of Successful People</h2>
				<P>My latest video is my longest one and probably the one that took the most hours to finish. This time I’ve decided to take a different approach and try something new. I haven’t used motivational speakers this time, I’ve only used speeches from really successful people. I wanted the video to be as authentic as possible. The speakers I’ve used are Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Lopez, Steve Jobs, Justin Timberlake, Usain Bolt, Steve Harvey, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Conor MgGregor. I hope you will enjoy this video as much as I did while creating it.</P>

			<hr style="margin-left: 70px; margin-top: 20px; width: 770px;">
			<p>As most of you know by now –  I produce motivational videos that have inspired over 50 million people and today I am sharing with you my latest motivational video. This time – I’ve tried to create something unique and I hope you will enjoy this video as much as you enjoy my previous ones..</p>

				<h2>The Real Value In Giving A TED Talk</h2>
				<p>When I stepped off the stage at Rush University in May of 2014, I stepped off having accomplished a major life goal. I had just delivered a TED Talk (or TEDx if we want to split hairs); something I had wanted to accomplish before turning 30 (I had done it at 25).
				<br>It was this amazing feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment, combined with the thought of “NAAAAILED IIIT!”</p>

				<h2>This Motivational Video Will Give You The Chills</h2>
				<P>Every month I publish a new motivational video on our YouTube channel. This month I did something a little bit different – I decided to do a video that’s more inspirational, and not so motivational. The speech was written by my friend Eddie Pinero from YourWorldWithin and the feedback has been amazing. I hope you will enjoy this video as much as I did while creating it!</P>

			<h1>This Video Will Give You Goosebumps</h1>
			<hr style="margin-left: 70px; margin-top: 20px; width: 770px;">
			<p>People always ask me which is the best motivational video that I’ve created, well the answer to that question is I still haven’t created my best video and that’s what inspires me to keep producing new ones! My youtube channel has already passed 40 million views, but my drive to create better videos is still as strong as when I started and maybe in the future I will create my best video and stop producing new ones, but for now I will keep inspiring people in the best way I can.</p>

				<h2>The Other Guy</h2>
				<p>For those of you that love motivational videos this will be a great addition to your motivational playlist. This video is one of my shortest, yet it’s one that teaches a really powerful life lesson about not giving up in life. I’ve used the movies Up In The Air and Limitless to create this video and I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did while creating it!</p>

				<h2>Nothing Will Stop Me</h2>
				<P>What is stopping you from achieving your dreams? Maybe you think that your friends or your parents are stopping you, but that’s not true – the only one that is stopping you is YOU. Everything else is an excuse you are making in order to justify your inaction. You are the one that is responsible for your dreams and your life, nobody is going to achieve your dreams for you. And realizing that is the first step towards making your dreams a reality.</P>

			<h1>The Best Motivational Video Speeches Compilation</h1>
			<hr style="margin-left: 70px; margin-top: 20px; width: 770px;">
			<p>Motivational videos are so powerful nowadays, they inspire us to believe in our dreams and take action towards achieving them. They are like food for the soul, and there are so many great videos right now that it’s hard to just choose the best, so I decided to create a compilation that you can listen while driving, while working, while in the gym or while running or maybe while studying. Well I don’t know when you are going to listen to that compilation, but what I know is that it’s definitely going to motivate you, after all I included some of the greatest videos on youtube. Now, it’s time to to get to work, listen to this powerful compilation!</p>

				<h2>Stop Killing Time  </h2>
				<P>As you know I publish new motivational video on my Youtube channel every 1st day of the month and this time I’ve done something different. For the first time I’ve used a female motivational speaker for the whole video, and the feedback has been 2-sided, some like it and some don’t.  The video main topic is about the importance of time. Also don’t forget to subscribe to my youtube channel, to get instant updates when a new motivational video gets published. And let me tell you that some amazing videos are cooming up!</P>
